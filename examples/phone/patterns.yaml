# Patterns: weave the regex expression groups together

Basic Phone:
    Pattern: <Phone>
    Order: 1

Fax Phone:
    # Pattern: Also a regular expression
    # Angle brackets tag such as <Class> contains the Expression class you want there
    # Each class contains one or more groups |ed together.

    Pattern: |
      Fax: \s <Phone>

    # Order: If you have multiple patterns, you can use this field to 'weight' them
    # For example, if you have 3 matching patterns, the most complex one
    # Is the one you probably want, so put the highest number in Order: on that one.
    Order: 2

    # I could have used <Basic Phone> instead to use a pattern inside a pattern but
    # it wouldn't have made a difference really (just an extra function call).
