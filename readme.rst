RE\|PARSE
=========

*Python library/tools for combining and using Regular Expressions in a maintainable way*

[|Build Status| `Download/View Source on Github`_] [`Docs at ReadtheDocs`_]

This library also allows you to:

- Maintain a database of Regular Expressions
- Combine them together using Patterns
- Search, Parse and Output data matched by combined Regex using Python functions.

A Taste / Getting Started
=========================

(See the examples/ directory for more details)

I want to parse this
--------------------

::

     blah blah blah go to the store to buy green at 11pm! blah blah

Expressions written in Yaml
---------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    Color:
        Basic Color:
            Expression: (Orange|Green)
            Matches: Orange | Green
            Non-Matches: Blue
            Groups:
              - Color

    Time:
        Basic Time:
            Expression: ([0-9]|[1][0-2]) \s? (am|pm)
            Matches: 8am | 8 am
            Non-Matches: 8a | 8 a | 8:00 am
            Groups:
              - Hour
              - AMPM

Patterns written in Yaml
------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

    BasicColorTime:
      Order: 1
      Pattern: |
        <Color> (?: \s? at \s? )? <Time>

Functions written in Python
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import time
    def color_time(Color=None, Time=None):
        Color, Hour, Period = Color[0], int(Time[0]), Time[1]
        if Period == 'pm':
            Hour += 12
        Time = time(hour=Hour)

        return Color, Time

Result
------

.. code-block:: python

    [('green', datetime.time(23, 0))]
